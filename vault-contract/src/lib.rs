//! NEAR OutLayer per-customer vault contract.
//!
//! Deployed by a customer onto a sub-account of their NEAR account
//! (e.g. `vault.alice.near`) in a single atomic transaction together with
//! `CreateAccount`, `DeployContract`, `FunctionCall("new", ...)`, and an
//! `AddKey` action that installs the OutLayer TEE keystore worker's
//! function-call key. After that atomic transaction the customer holds NO
//! keys on the vault — the only access key is the TEE function-call key,
//! restricted to calling `request_app_private_key` on the MPC contract.
//!
//! This contract enforces two recovery paths back to parent control:
//!
//! 1. **Cessation-triggered (catastrophic):** the OutLayer DAO declares
//!    cessation; anyone can call `initiate_recovery`, the cross-contract
//!    `is_ceased()` check gates progress, fixed 7-day delay before
//!    `finalize_recovery` is allowed.
//! 2. **Unilateral-triggered (voluntary):** the customer's parent account
//!    calls `unilateral_initiate_recovery` at any time, no DAO involvement,
//!    delay configurable between 24h and 30d via `set_exit_window`.
//!
//! Both paths share `RecoveryState` and `finalize_recovery`; the state's
//! `trigger` field decides whether `finalize_recovery` re-checks
//! `is_ceased()` (Cessation) or relies on window timing only (Unilateral).
//!
//! ## Security guarantees (audit checklist)
//! * `new()` does NOT add or manipulate keys.
//! * No method calls `Promise::new(current).deploy_contract(...)` — vault
//!   cannot self-upgrade.
//! * The TEE function-call access key is bound to `mpc_contract` and
//!   `request_app_private_key` only — it cannot trigger any vault method.
//! * The only Promise actions that add access keys to the vault are
//!   emitted from `callback_add_tee_key` (DAO-gated, function-call only)
//!   and `unlocked_add_key` (parent-gated, only after a successful
//!   `finalize_recovery`).
//! * `finalize_recovery` re-checks `is_ceased()` only when
//!   `trigger == Cessation`. If the DAO revoked cessation in the 7-day
//!   window the recovery state is cleared and the vault stays locked.
//!   Unilateral recoveries are independent of DAO state.
//! * Only one recovery can be in flight at a time, regardless of trigger
//!   (`recovery.is_none()` precondition on both initiate methods).
//! * `set_exit_window` only affects future unilateral recoveries — the
//!   active recovery's `finalize_before` is frozen at initiate time.
//! * `registered_tee_keys` is capped at [`MAX_REGISTERED_TEE_KEYS`] (32)
//!   to bound state size against the permissionless `propose_tee_key`.
//!
//! ## Out of scope for v1
//! * **TEE key revocation.** There is no `revoke_tee_key` method. When a
//!   keystore-worker version is rotated the previous TEE key remains an
//!   active access key on the vault account. Mitigation: deploy a new
//!   vault-contract version (DAO-approved code hash) for any rotation
//!   that needs to retire the old key. Operationally the old key can
//!   only call `request_app_private_key` on the MPC contract, which is
//!   itself DAO-gated, so a stale key on a vault is bounded in blast
//!   radius.
