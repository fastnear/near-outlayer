# wallet-probe

A WASI module whose only job is exercising the `outlayer:wallet` host
functions.

Until this existed, nothing in `wasi-examples/` imported that world. The
interface was described in `worker/wit/deps/wallet.wit`, implemented in
`worker/src/outlayer_wallet/host_functions.rs`, unit-tested on the worker's
side — and reached by no guest anywhere. A break in the guest-facing half would
have surfaced first in somebody's agent, in production, as a wallet call that
returned nothing.

## Why it is not part of `connector-probe`

The worker gives a component the wallet host functions only if the component
**imports** them (`has_wallet_import` in `worker/src/executor/wasi_p2.rs`), and
if it imports them while the request carries no wallet id, the worker refuses to
instantiate it at all:

```
WASM imports outlayer:wallet/api but wallet is not available.
Wallet requires: X-Wallet-Id header in the execution request.
```

That happens before `main` runs. Most calls to `connector-probe` carry no
wallet — every payment-key call, every trial-key call, every on-chain
`request_execution` — so adding the import there would have failed all of them,
`ping` included. One import would have taken the whole probe down.

So the split is forced rather than chosen: **a module that imports the wallet
can only ever be called with a wallet**, and that is the entire contract of this
one.

## Not a connector

No `connector_id` in the manifest, so it is an ordinary project: no curated
registry entry, no on-chain price table, no per-operation fee. It needs none of
that — the wallet calls are host functions, so there is no egress to allow and
nothing to price per operation.

The manifest is still embedded, and it says one thing worth saying:

```json
"capabilities": { "network": [] }
```

For an ordinary project an empty list is **enforced** while a missing key is
not, and those are different claims. So a module that can move money here
cannot talk to the internet, and `build.sh` checks the section is in the
artefact rather than trusting that it is.

### Deploy it under a normal account, NOT `connectors.outlayer.*`

Being a connector is a line in `connector_registry.rs` and a coordinator
deploy, so publishing under the connector namespace would not make this one —
`lookup_by_project_id` matches an exact name in that hardcoded list. What it
WOULD do is put it inside other people's spending scope: a trial key is issued
scoped to `{connectors namespace}/*`, and `scope_allows` matches by **owner**,
not by registry membership. A non-connector sitting in that namespace is
therefore payable out of the trial allowance we give away, at compute price,
for a module that exists to be poked at.

Anywhere else is fine — `zavodil.testnet/wallet-probe` and the like. Nothing
about the wallet host functions depends on the owner.

## Calling it

Two things are required and neither is optional:

* `Authorization: Bearer wk_...` — the custody wallet's own key. An ordinary
  payment key identifies no wallet, and the call is refused with
  `X-Wallet-Id cannot be honoured for this credential`.
* `X-Wallet-Id: <wallet id>` — the wallet must be **named**. An absent header,
  or one with an empty value, means "no wallet": the header is trimmed and
  dropped when blank, and a call that never asked for a wallet does not get
  one. For this module that is not a quieter run, it is a refusal to start.

Get the id from `GET /wallet/v1/address?chain=near` (`wallet_id` in the
response), then:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$COORDINATOR_URL/call/$OWNER/wallet-probe" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WK" \
  -H "X-Wallet-Id: $WALLET_ID" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input":{"operation":"whoami"}}'
```

The id you send must be your own. Naming another wallet is refused
(`match_requested_wallet`), which is the point: the header requests the wallet
the credential already identifies, it never selects one.

## Operations

| `operation` | Moves money | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `whoami` | no | `wallet::get_id` answers, and its answer matches the `WALLET_ID` the environment was given. Two sources for one fact, and only the host function is authoritative |
| `balance` | no | the derived NEAR address and what it holds — the two reads an agent makes before deciding to spend |
| `transfer` | **yes** | what a refusal looks like from inside a guest: the code, whether retrying is pointless, and which request holds the wallet |
| `request_status` | no | the id out of a `wallet_busy` refusal is one a guest can actually poll |

`transfer` takes `to` and `amount` (yoctoNEAR, decimal string):

```json
{"input":{"operation":"transfer","to":"bob.testnet","amount":"1000000000000000000000"}}
```

A caller-chosen recipient is safe here in a way a caller-chosen HTTP host would
not be: the host function acts as the caller's own wallet under that wallet's
own policy, so the worst it can name is a destination for their own money —
which they can already reach through `POST /wallet/v1/transfer` without this
module.

## Reading the answer

Every `wallet::*` function returns `(result, error)`, and the error carries
everything an agent must decide next. This module does not pass the string
through — it **parses** it and reports the pieces, because an error a program
can route on is a different thing from one a human can read:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "operation": "transfer",
  "detail": "refused as `wallet_busy` — the wallet is held by request 9f1c-42. Poll it with …",
  "error": "wallet_busy: another operation is using this wallet … in_flight_request_id=9f1c-42",
  "error_parsed": {
    "code": "wallet_busy",
    "message": "another operation is using this wallet …",
    "in_flight_request_id": "9f1c-42"
  }
}
```

Two conventions that matter when reading a run:

* **`ok` is about the ANSWER, not about the outcome.** A well-formed refusal is
  a working interface, so `transfer` reports `ok: true` for it. What sets
  `ok: false` is an answer nothing can be done with: no machine code, or both
  halves of the tuple empty.
* **A missing `terminal` is missing, not `false`.** An agent that reads absence
  as "retryable" hammers a permanent refusal.

## Producing a `wallet_busy` refusal

It cannot be done from inside one run. The host functions block, so a single
guest's calls never overlap — the wallet has to be held by something else.
Start a slower operation on the same wallet first (a swap, a cross-chain
withdraw, or another `/wallet/v1/call`), then call `transfer` here within it.
The refusal arrives after the grace period, which is 2 seconds
(`WALLET_BUSY_GRACE` in the coordinator).

Then feed the `in_flight_request_id` straight back:

```json
{"input":{"operation":"request_status","request_id":"9f1c-42"}}
```

That second call is the half nothing else checks. A busy refusal that names a
request nobody can read is a dead end dressed as an instruction.

## Publishing

```bash
./build.sh          # checks the WIT copy, the manifest section and the wallet import
outlayer deploy     # or upload the wasm and publish a version by hash
```

`build.sh` refuses to produce an artefact that does not import
`outlayer:wallet/api`: a build without it would run happily and test nothing.
It also diffs `wit/wallet.wit` against the worker's copy and reports a drift
rather than fixing it — which side is right is a decision, not a build step.
