# NEAR OutLayer

**Move your computation offshore. Keep your security on-chain.s**

---

## The Problem

Smart contracts on blockchain face the same constraints as businesses in high-tax jurisdictions:

- ⛽ **High operational costs** (gas fees for every computation)
- 🐌 **Strict limitations** (can't run complex algorithms)
- 🚫 **Regulatory restrictions** (blockchain consensus limits what's possible)
- 💸 **Expensive operations** (ML models, simulations, heavy math = impossible)

Developers are forced to choose between:
- **Keep everything on-chain** → Expensive, slow, limited
- **Build L2/sidechain** → Complexity, fragmented liquidity, bridging hell
- **Use traditional cloud** → Lose blockchain guarantees, trust AWS

---

## The Solution: NEAR OutLayer

Just as businesses move assets **offshore** for efficiency while keeping control and ownership, smart contracts can now move computation **offshore** while keeping funds and security on NEAR L1.

### How It Works

```
1. Your smart contract calls execute() → Pauses execution (yield)
2. Computation runs offshore → Fast, cheap, unlimited power
3. Results return with proof → Contract resumes with verified results
4. Funds never leave NEAR → Security and settlement on L1
```

**It's like opening a Cayman Islands account for your computation** - optimize costs and efficiency offshore, but ownership and control stay with you.

## Why "Offshore"?

The metaphor is perfect:

| Financial Offshore | NEAR OutLayer |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Lower taxes | Lower gas costs (100x) |
| Efficient operations | Unlimited computation |
| Privacy & confidentiality | Secret management (TEE) |
| Regulatory optimization | No blockchain limits |
| Assets still yours | Results return to your contract |
| Ownership on home jurisdiction | Settlement on NEAR L1 |

## What Makes It Unique?

### 🔐 **TEE-Attested Security**
- Computation runs in Trusted Execution Environments (Intel SGX / AWS Nitro)
- Cryptographic proof that code executed correctly
- Secrets encrypted, never exposed to operator
- **Trustless like blockchain, efficient like cloud**

### 🔍 **Fully Transparent**
- All code on GitHub (public repos only)
- Anyone can audit before using
- Reproducible builds from commit hashes
- **If you can read the code, you can trust the execution**

### ⚡ **Asynchronous Architecture**
- First call: compiles your code (3-5 min)
- Subsequent calls: instant execution (cached)
- Pay only for what you use
- **"Tax haven" pricing for computation**

### 🌍 **No L2 Complexity**
- No new chain to secure
- No bridging
- No fragmented liquidity
- **Pure L1 with offshore benefits**

## The Offshore Advantage

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User → Smart Contract → Try to do everything on-chain
        ↓
    Gas explosion 💥
    Or impossible entirely 🚫
```

**NEAR OutLayer Approach:**
```
User → Smart Contract → Call Offshore → Get results
        ↓                    ↓              ↓
    Stays cheap       Runs heavy      Returns verified
    Stays secure      computation     Continues execution
```

## Why Now?

### ✅ **NEAR is uniquely positioned**
- `yield/resume` mechanism (no other L1 has this)
- Fast finality (no 15-minute confirmation waits)
- Low L1 fees (affordable for small operations)
- Developer-friendly (Rust, TypeScript SDKs)

### ✅ **TEE technology is mature**
- AWS Nitro Enclaves (production-ready)
- Intel SGX (battle-tested)
- Cryptographic attestation (industry standard)
- No need to trust operators

### ✅ **Market needs it**
- DeFi needs better execution (MEV, optimization)

## The Vision

**NEAR OutLayer is foundational infrastructure that makes the impossible possible.**

Just as financial offshore zones enabled global business optimization, NEAR OutLayer enables computational optimization for the blockchain era.

### Today:
Smart contracts are constrained by gas, just like businesses are constrained by high taxes.

### Tomorrow:
Smart contracts move heavy computation offshore, just like businesses move assets offshore—optimizing for efficiency while maintaining control.

### The Result:
**A new category of blockchain applications that were theoretically possible but practically infeasible.**

## Pricing Model

**Pay-per-use, like AWS Lambda but cheaper:**

```
Cost = Base Fee + Resources Used

Example:
- Simple calculation: ~$0.02
- ML inference: ~$1.36
- Long computation: ~$3.11

vs. On-chain:
- Same operations: $50-500 in gas
```

**No refunds policy:**
- Protects against DoS
- Fair pricing (pay for resources, not success)
- Predictable costs
