# OutLayer sovereign-vault recovery walkthrough.
#
# Takes a vault FROM "OutLayer is serving it under a TEE function-call
# key" TO "I (the customer) own this vault outright and OutLayer can
# no longer sign anything bound to it". After the walkthrough you also
# recover the per-vault master locally so secrets stored against the
# vault stay decryptable.
#
# Run as the PARENT account that originally deployed the vault.
#
# Required tools:
#   * outlayer  (https://github.com/out-layer/cli)
#   * cargo     (to build the customer-recovery helper binary)
#   * jq        (response parsing)
#
# Optional:
#   * curl      (called for RPC view queries — pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
#
# What the script does:
#
#   0. Build the `customer-recovery` binary that lives in this same
#      directory. It owns both the local keygen (step 1) and the
#      master-recovery via MPC (step 5).
#
#   1. Generate a brand-new ed25519 keypair ON YOUR MACHINE. The
#      private key never leaves this shell. The public half is what
#      you'll hand to the vault contract as the future sole owner.
#      Saved to ~/.outlayer-recovery/<vault_id>.json, mode 0600.
#
#   2. Initiate unilateral recovery. The vault timer starts counting
#      down `unilateral_exit_window_secs` (default 24h; the customer
#      can shorten via `set-exit-window` BEFORE running this script).
#      Idempotent: if a previous run left a recovery in progress,
#      we detect it and skip the call (the timer is already set).
#
#   3. Wait for the window to elapse. The script just sleeps.
#
#   4. Finalize recovery passing your new pubkey. ONE atomic tx
#      simultaneously:
#         * deletes every TEE access key OutLayer was using (initial
#           one installed at deploy + any DAO-rotation keys)
#         * adds your new pubkey as a FullAccess key
#         * sets `unlocked = true` and clears the recovery state
#      After this the vault is on-chain controlled by your private
#      key. OutLayer's keystore physically cannot sign
#      `vault.request_master` anymore (no on-chain access key for it),
#      and the off-chain master cache is dropped within seconds by
#      `outlayer-monitor` reacting to the finalize log event.
#
#   5. Recover the per-vault master via MPC CKD using your new
#      private key. The master is the secret OutLayer was holding in
#      TEE memory; you re-derive it deterministically by calling
#      `mpc.request_app_private_key` with the same parameters
#      OutLayer used. After this you can decrypt every secret ever
#      stored against the vault — entirely offline from OutLayer's
#      infrastructure.
#
# DO NOT lose the private-key file after step 1. It is now the ONLY
# thing that can sign tx for the vault. Back it up to cold storage
# immediately after the script runs.
