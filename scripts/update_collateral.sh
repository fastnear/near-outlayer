# Update a register-contract collateral SLOT (Phase-1 multi-FMSPC support).
#
# The register-contract (worker.outlayer.<net>) now holds up to MAX_COLLATERALS collaterals,
# one per platform/FMSPC. register_worker_key reads the FMSPC out of the worker's quote and
# verifies ONLY the slot whose collateral matches it (a single dcap-qvl verify, regardless of
# how many slots are cached — so adding slots never raises the per-registration gas).
# Slots:   0 = Phala         (FMSPC 20a06f000000)
#          1 = self-hosted TDX (FMSPC B0C06F000000)
# Updating one slot does NOT delete the others (mixed fleet coexists).
#
# The collateral is the Intel DCAP verification material (TCB info, QE identity, PCK CRLs/certs)
# keyed by the platform's FMSPC. It is **platform-specific, NOT network-specific** — the SAME file
# is used for testnet AND mainnet (it certifies the TDX hardware/TCB, not the NEAR network); just
# cache it on each network's contract. It IS time-sensitive: regenerate when Intel's TCB/CRLs
# update or registration fails with a TCB/collateral error (e.g. status != UpToDate).
#
# Generate the collateral JSON per platform FIRST:
#   - Phala:       from the Phala PCCS (as before).
#   - self-hosted: ON THE NODE, as the `outlayer` user, with the patched dcap-qvl (v0.3.12 — dumps
#     QuoteCollateralV3 + accepts the self-signed local PCCS). `--hex` is a FLAG; the arg is a quote
#     FILE (not the hex string). A reusable platform quote is saved at /home/outlayer/platform-quote.hex
#     (any TDX quote from THIS platform works — the collateral is per-FMSPC, not per-quote):
#       ssh root@173.237.9.76
#       su - outlayer -c 'cd /tmp && PCCS_URL=https://localhost:8081 \
#         /home/outlayer/dcap-qvl/cli/target/release/dcap-qvl verify --hex /home/outlayer/platform-quote.hex'
#       # prints "Quote verified" (status UpToDate) + writes /tmp/our_collateral.json
#       # then from your laptop, pull it in CANONICAL form (see the strip note below — this is what
#       # keeps the committed file identical no matter which node generated it):
#       #   ssh root@<node> 'jq -S "del(.pck_certificate_chain)" /tmp/our_collateral.json' \
#       #     > scripts/our_collateral.json
#     (If platform-quote.hex is lost, extract any worker's quote from its app_cert ext OID
#      1.3.6.1.4.1.62397.1.8; the FMSPC must be B0C06F000000.)
#
# Usage: ./scripts/update_collateral.sh <collateral.json> <index> [network] [contract]
#   ./scripts/update_collateral.sh our_collateral.json 1 testnet        # self-hosted TDX -> slot 1, testnet
#   ./scripts/update_collateral.sh our_collateral.json 1 mainnet        # SAME file -> slot 1, mainnet
#   ./scripts/update_collateral.sh phala_collateral.json 0 testnet      # Phala -> slot 0
#
# After the on-chain call, the coordinator is asked to capture the new version into its
# `collateral_versions` history (POST /admin/collateral/check). That history is what lets a past
# attestation still be verified once this slot has been overwritten — the contract keeps only the
# newest version per slot and Intel's PCS serves only the current one, so a superseded collateral
# survives nowhere else. The step is best-effort: the on-chain update has already succeeded by then,
# and a missed capture is recoverable later from the transaction history
# (outlayer-coordinator/scripts/backfill_collateral_versions.py).
#
# Put the coordinator credentials in a `.env` NEXT TO THIS SCRIPT (gitignored):

# That field is the PCK certificate of the ONE machine whose quote generated the collateral (the
# `dcap-qvl verify` path sets it; Intel's/Phala's PCCS path does not). dcap-qvl 0.3.11 PREFERS it
# over the chain embedded in the quote under verification:
#     verify.rs / verify_pck_cert_chain: "Extract PCK certificate chain - prefer collateral,
#                                         fall back to quote"
# PCK certs are per-CPU, so leaving it in pins the whole FMSPC slot to a single physical node: any
# other node with the same FMSPC then fails registration with
#     "TDX quote verification failed (signature/TCB/collateral mismatch):
#      Signature is invalid for qe_report in quote"
# Phala's slot 0 has no such field — that is exactly why one Phala collateral serves every Phala
# worker. TDX quotes carry their own type-5 PCK chain, so dropping it loses nothing and is what
# makes a slot cover the whole fleet on that platform.
