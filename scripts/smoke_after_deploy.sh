# Post-deploy smoke test for the coordinator + keystore release.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the unit suites check logic inside a process. Almost everything that actually
# breaks a release breaks at a seam they cannot see — a keystore that came up but never got its
# DAO vote, a route that moved, a token that was not rotated, a timeout that is now too short, a
# certificate the edge will not accept. This runs the real endpoints and names the first thing
# that is wrong, in the order you would want to hear it.
#
# Run it IMMEDIATELY after deploying, before telling anyone the release is out.

# Config comes from `scripts/.env` (see scripts/.env.example). Checks whose config is missing are
# reported SKIP, not PASS — a skipped check has verified nothing, and the summary says so.
#
# Exit code: 0 only if nothing FAILED. Skips do not fail the run, but they are counted.
