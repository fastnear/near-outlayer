# Report — and optionally retire — everything belonging to OLD keystore versions.
#
# Run it as the LAST step of an upgrade: new keystore deployed and voted in, workers and
# coordinator repointed at it, everything verified. Then this drops the previous versions.
#
# How "old" is decided: every approved key is grouped by the IMAGE it registered under (the
# measurements recorded in its registration proposal). The image of the most recent
# registration is CURRENT; every other image is OLD. Grouping by image — not by key — is what
# makes this stable:
#   * a fleet of several instances of the current version keeps ALL of its keys;
#   * an instance that restarted and re-registered produces a new proposal with the SAME
#     measurements, so it stays in the current group instead of looking "newer";
#   * keys whose proposal is unreadable (they pre-date the current proposal format) are old by
#     construction — those proposals are the oldest ones on the contract.
#   * gateway-mode instances carry their instance-id in RTMR3, so two instances of ONE version
#     register with the same MRTD/RTMR0-2 and different RTMR3 — exactly what a version bump on
#     the same dstack image looks like. The chain cannot tell the two apart, so the script does
#     not guess: when such keys exist and no live key was named (KEEP_* / --keep), the run aborts
#     before printing a plan; once live keys are named, every other key is retired.
#
# What it retires, in one run:
#   1. the OLD keys    — `propose_revoke_keystore_keys` (one proposal per <=16 keys, signed by
#                        zavodil.*). With a single DAO member the proposal executes in the same
#                        call; with more members the others just vote by id, with the same
#                        `vote {"proposal_id":N,"approve":true}` used for registrations
#   2. the OLD images  — allowlist rebuilt to the current image(s), so a retired image can
#                        never register again (owner-signed, one atomic call)
# Both belong here rather than at deploy time: while an old instance is still serving, removing
# its key or its image breaks it — its registration key is ephemeral, so it cannot re-register
# after a restart.
#
# A retired instance keeps answering from RAM for vaults it already loaded, but cannot derive a
# master for a NEW vault and cannot survive a restart. Shut it down afterwards.
#
# Which keys are live is taken from the nodes, not guessed. On every TDX node
#   outlayer keystore-keys <testnet|mainnet>
# prints `export KEEP_<SITE>="<key> <key>"` (KEEP_DAL on dal, KEEP_AMS on ams) with the registration
# key of each running keystore CVM there (read from its log). Paste both lines into the shell here
# and run the script: every key in them is kept, everything else is retired — one command per
# network after a release. BOTH variables must be set (empty is fine for a node without keystores);
# a missing one means a node was skipped, and its live instance would be revoked.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/revoke_old_keystore_keys.sh <testnet|mainnet> [--keep ed25519:KEY]... [--send]
#
#   --keep   the same as a key in a KEEP_* variable: a live instance (or one deliberately kept)
#   --send   execute here after a confirmation prompt; without it the script only prints the
#            report and ready-to-run commands (mainnet keys usually live on another machine)
