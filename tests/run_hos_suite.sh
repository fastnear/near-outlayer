# and the limiter lives in the coordinator's memory, so two suites in parallel
# produce 429s and connection resets that are indistinguishable from defects.

cat >&2 <<'MAP'
  R0   executor→asset w_execute_extension executes and is tracked
       live   decoder §D0 (executed, tx hash), endpoints §E11'''' (the builder), lifecycle §R5a
  R1   a binding only after the owner's authorization and on-chain confirmation
       live   endpoints §E5/E5' (pending claims nothing, active is exclusive), fixture (kit → active)
       stub   lease §"the leased binding is ACTIVE" (the partner's view believed, then verified)
  R2   a limit breached INSIDE args → refused before signing
       live   decoder §R2 (250 NEAR nested, 1 yocto outside) and §R2-aggregate (split payment, one rule)
  R3   ft_transfer through a permitted token contract to a foreign logical recipient → refused
       live   decoder §R3, custody §F3/§G1 (per-token cap and token allowlist over the DECODED move)
  R4   any AddExtension / RemoveExtension / SetSignatureMode → hard deny
       live   decoder §R4 (all three ops, plus one smuggled beside a legal transfer)
  R5   the binding stops executing after transfer / recovery / revoke / expiry
       live   lifecycle §R5b–R5g (executor cut, wiped account, re-bind, DELETE)
       stub   lease §C-* (frozen, parked, suspended, lease expired) and §ROT (ownership rotation)
       stub   lease §PAIR1–3 — the collection's `nft_token` held against the account's
              `nft_item_info`: a disagreement suspends AND the gate refuses (registry_disagrees,
              not terminal); agreement brings the lane back without re-binding
       live   bravo §B6 — the rotation HoS performs on request (ROTATED=1 phase):
              transitional refusal, closure recorded, then binding_ended
       live   lease §W — the revoke webhook, when `BINDING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is exported.
              Without it the suite says so rather than passing quietly; the secret is in
              `prod_configs/coordinator/.env.testnet` and the coordinator must be carrying it
  R6   gas: source, submit, retry, replay specified and exercised
       live   endpoints §E12 (the balance is on /address), custody §L (one spend at a time)
       live   gas §F1/§F4 — the 0.05 NEAR warning on the binding flips both ways, and the
              threshold it measured against is named
       live   gas §F2 — an executor starved below the cost of a call is refused 402
              wallet_underfunded, naming what it holds and what the call costs, with the
              money still sitting untouched in the bound account
       live   gas §F3 — and the refused request is SETTLED (failed / never_admitted) rather
              than left for a repair to reconstruct. Needs PSQL_CMD
       live   gas §F4 — the same envelope goes through once the executor can pay, which is
              what makes the three refusals above refusals ABOUT GAS
  R7   reads do not mix the two identities
       live   endpoints §E10/E12/E13 (asset vs executor, intents sent to the right door, /balance unmoved)
       stub   lease reserve_yocto is read from hos_agent_status (§R1)
       live   bravo §B3 — the floor binds on the real account (ceiling above balance),
              §B4 — the item fence, the collection wall and the own-collection rule on
              the real grant, §B5 — carry-forward across a refill. Run APART from this
              runner (wk_-authenticated: `hos_lease_bravo_e2e.sh`), like the alpha suite
  R8   one operation traceable from API to inner receipts
       live   identity §I7 walks the HTTPS door from the only handle a client is given — the call id
              — through https_calls, the execution request, the job and the worker that ran it, to
              the TEE attestation at /attestations/by-call
       live   bound_identity_onchain §B7 walks the other door from the only handle a caller holds
              there — the transaction hash — to the chain's own inner receipts, the job and worker,
              the priced record, and /attestations/by-tx. Run APART from this runner: it needs an
              existing binding (BINDING_SEED + ASSET), which nothing here produces
       live   attribution on both doors: identity §I6/§I6b and §B6 — the request row and the
              earnings row name the PAYER, never the account the guest borrowed
       needs  PSQL_CMD. Without it those sections skip and say so, and nothing below the answer
              envelope is judged at all
  R9   an unsupported impl_version is rejected before signing
       live   endpoints §E3i (PUT refuses version 999, names the supported set, says terminal)
       stub   lease §C-version (a chain that reports version 5 → unsupported_wallet_implementation)
  R10  a confidential operation end to end
       live   endpoints §E16 — the TESTNET half: the routes answer 503 with NO `Retry-After`
              and a sentence naming the deployment, so a client cannot read "off" as "busy"
       live   the `confidential` capability is a per-wallet policy gate like the others
              (`Capabilities::confidential`), which is what R10 asks of the policy shape
       external the operation itself is mainnet only — there are no solvers on testnet
  R11  sign-in / proof of ownership
       external not part of this integration: the wallet's own NEP-413 path
  R12  a spend over the granted budget is refused, and reported as terminal
       live   lease §G4/§G5 and live-grant §G8/§G9 — the per-token and native walls,
              with §G9 asserting the `terminal` flag the client routes on
       live   lease §G0/§R12 — the chain's OWN refusal: the stub answers views and has
              no `w_execute_extension`, so a request the pre-flight admits comes back
              422 `chain_refused` with no `Retry-After`. That shape is unreachable
              through the grant walls above, which our pre-flight answers first
