# §0′ [REV-0831] of the HoS test plan — the `hos_lease` profile against the
# PARTNER'S SECOND leased account, `bravo.tlademo.testnet`, whose grant is
# shaped for the branches alpha's cannot reach: a native ceiling ABOVE the
# account's balance (so the reserve floor binds), an item fence on a separate
# collection (so the NFT rungs are live), and a refill on request (so
# carry-forward is observable). `hos_lease_live_e2e.sh` covers the rest on
# alpha; the two suites share nothing but the shape.
#
# AUTH. As on alpha: a coordinator-minted wallet, `wk_`-authenticated, one
# wallet per leased account (one wallet is one live binding). The file is
# `keystore-worker/.env.hos2` (executor `68f651d8…f47f41`).
#
# What this covers, and what each needs:
#   B0  the wk_ resolves to the executor HoS whitelisted on bravo
#   B1  PUT hos_lease → 200, executor echoed
#   B2  ACTIVE off the real hos_agent_status; the collection's `nft_token`
#       confirms the account's `nft_item_info`
#   B3  the reserve floor: a spend that would leave the account below
#       `reserve_yocto` is refused BEFORE gas as insufficient_vs_reserve; a
#       small spend lands and the meter moves. The refused probe leaves the
#       account 0.001 NEAR under the floor and costs nothing; the control is
#       SMALL on purpose — "just under the floor" would drain the account to
#       the floor and kill every later native probe.
#   B4  the item fence (needs FENCE_COLLECTION + FENCE_TOKEN_IDS from HoS):
#       a fenced token moves (once — it is gone afterwards, HoS re-mints);
#       an unfenced token in the granted collection → item_not_granted;
#       a collection the grant never named → collection_not_granted;
#       the account's OWN collection (its registry) → own_collection_refused
#   B5  carry-forward: the meter is printed; with CARRY_BASELINE=<spent before
#       the refill> the suite asserts it carried (or, with EXPECT_RESET=1,
#       that a revoke+grant reset it)
#   B6  rotation (ROTATED=1, after HoS rotated bravo at our request, against a
#       binding left by a previous KEEP=1 run): the transitional spend is
#       refused terminally with the chain's own class, a status read records
#       the closure, and the next spend is refused as binding_ended
#
# The suite stops after B2 with a note, not a failure, while bravo is not yet
# provisioned (no grant, executor not in the set): that is a state of theirs,
# not a defect of ours.
#
# ── COST WARNING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# B3's control and B4's fenced transfer SPEND the grant; HoS refills on request
# — shout when a run empties it. Everything refused pre-flight spends nothing.
