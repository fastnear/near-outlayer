//! A stand-in for the partner's leased-account contract — the ONE view our
//! pre-flight reads, and nothing else.
//!
//! Why this exists (test plan §10): every `hos_lease` rule we implement — the
//! grant ladder, the call-form rules, the reserve floor, the lifecycle faults,
//! the version gate — is decided by what `hos_agent_status` answers. Until the
//! partner leases us a real account we cannot make that view say "the grant
//! expired" or "the lease ran out" on a live chain, so the whole mode would be
//! provable only in unit vectors. This contract makes the view say anything a
//! test needs it to, on testnet, through the real coordinator.
//!
//! What it deliberately does NOT do: enforce anything. It is a mirror, not a
//! second implementation. Proving that the partner's contract PANICS where our
//! pre-flight refuses is their account's job, and no stub can stand in for it —
//! see the boundary §10 asks us to state plainly.
//!
//! The stored answer is raw JSON, returned verbatim. A typed struct would
//! quietly normalise exactly the malformed and truncated shapes the fail-closed
//! cases are about (a missing `state`, a `lease_until_ns` that is not a number,
//! a grant with an unknown field), and those cases are half the point.
