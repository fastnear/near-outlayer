# §3 of the HoS test plan — the decoder and the core (mode-blind) policy over
# `w_execute_extension`. The largest attack surface we expose to the partner:
# the outer call says nothing (its receiver is the agent's own wallet contract,
# its deposit is a 1-yocto marker) and every real recipient and amount is
# nested in base64 args. Everything a rule is supposed to measure has to be
# read out of that blob, and everything the blob can be is tried here.
#
# The suite is deliberately built out of REFUSALS: a refusal is decided before
# anything is signed, so it costs no gas and no custody quota, and it is also
# the answer that matters — a decoder that fails open is the whole risk. The
# few allows are the negative controls §9 demands, without which a green run
# would also be green against a door that refuses everything.
#
# Distinguishing a DECODE refusal from a POLICY refusal without reading
# sentences: each decode case is aimed at an address the policy does NOT
# permit, so a working decoder answers with the ADDRESS rule (it got far
# enough to see the destination) and a broken one answers with a parse error.
# The pair pins which layer spoke.
