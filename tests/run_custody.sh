#
# Every custody suite, in one run.
#
# `run_all.sh` deliberately does not carry these: it is the build-and-compile
# gate, it must stay fast and free, and these spend real testnet NEAR, need a
# database wrapper, and take the better part of an hour. But left out of any
# runner at all they were the best tests in the repo and nothing ran them —
# which is how a suite ends up not executable, or unable to fail, without
# anyone noticing.
#
# WHAT IT DOES ABOUT THE THINGS THAT BITE:
#
#   Rate limit. The coordinator allows 100 requests/minute per IP, and over it
#   answers with resets and `HTTP 000` that read like product failures — one
#   evening of this session went to diagnosing it. Suites run STRICTLY
#   sequentially with a gap between them ($GAP, default 75s).
#
#   Network. `outlayer` follows ~/.outlayer/default-network unless told
#   otherwise, which on this machine is MAINNET. Exported once, here.
#
#   The binding. Three suites need an ACTIVE personal_account binding, and
#   minting one costs an account plus NEAR. This runner mints ONE with
#   binding_lifecycle (KEEP=1) and hands it to the rest, or takes yours.
#
#   Prerequisites. A suite whose inputs are missing is SKIPPED loudly, naming
#   exactly what is absent. It is never counted as a pass.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/run_custody.sh                       # print the plan, run nothing
#   PARENT=you.testnet PSQL_CMD=./tsql \
#     ./tests/run_custody.sh --apply             # everything it has inputs for
#   PARENT=you.testnet ./tests/run_custody.sh --apply velocity binding
#                                                # only the named suites
#
# Inputs (each suite states its own; supply what you have):
#   PARENT           a testnet account with a keychain credential and ~5 NEAR
#   PSQL_CMD         wrapper taking one SQL statement — the coordinator's
#                    database is not reachable off its host
#   FUNDER EXECUTOR RECIPIENT   three accounts, for the contract-level probes
#   MPC_PUBLIC_KEY   enables the dedicated-vault probes; without it the vault
#                    suite runs in default-vault mode
#   API_KEY APPROVER API_AUTH_TOKEN ADMIN_TOKEN BOUND_TO   per-suite extras
